# Black-Owned Biz

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and hosted with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This also will run the Firebase emulator in the background.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br />
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

The app is then deployed to the firebase server for hosting.
